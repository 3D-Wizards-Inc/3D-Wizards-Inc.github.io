## Overview

3D-Wizards Inc. is a business that develops and sells 3D printed products. The web application for the online store is currently under development, but final application will allows users to browse items, make orders, and get in contact with the business owners.

## Current Goals

The milestone we are currently working towards is M1. This milestone includes:

* Home Page
  > This page will list some of the popular products availabe and have an "About Us* section

* Product List Page
  > This page will contain all of the availabe items

* Custom Order Request Page
  > Customers will be able customize the size and color of their orders

* Navbar and Footer
  >The navbar will contain links to the business's instagram, the rest of the pages, and the sign in page. The footer will contain the contact info of the business.

When M1 is complete, we plan to implement additional features to the application such as a page for business propositions, a purchase history, and more custom ordering options.
